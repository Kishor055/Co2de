## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Upload** - Drop your code file (supports .js, .ts, .py, .java, .rs, .go, etc.)
2. **Analyze** - CO2DE scans for energy-intensive patterns
3. **Estimate** - Get instant energy/CO₂ estimates based on heuristics
4. **Optimize** - Receive AI-powered recommendations

## 📊 Metrics Explained

| Metric       | Description                      |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Energy (kWh) | Estimated energy consumption     |
| CO₂ (gCO2e)  | Estimated carbon footprint       |
| Complexity   | Code complexity factor (1.0-3.0) |
| Score (1-10) | Overall energy efficiency rating |

## 🌱 Why Green Software?

- Tech accounts for **2-4% of global emissions**
- Software energy use is growing **9% annually**
- Efficient code = fewer servers = less cooling = lower impact
